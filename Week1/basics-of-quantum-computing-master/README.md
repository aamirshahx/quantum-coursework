# QWorld's Basics of Quantum Computing

Our introductory material to introduce the basics of quantum computation and quantum programming. 

We plan to have three set of materials here: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**. 

## Bronze

Bronze is ready to use and it is being updated time to time.

Bronze is a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (nearly 80 notebooks) using python as the programming language and [qiskit library](https://qiskit.org) for writing quantum programs. New quantum libraries will be added.

_In Bronze, we focus on real numbers and skip to use complex numbers to keep the tutorial simpler._

Bronze can be used to organize 3-day long workshops or to design a 2-credit course for the second or third year university students 
by assuming that the participants/students would revise the notebooks for python and math by themselves. 

Bronze was created by [Dr. Abuzer Yakaryilmaz](http://abu.lu.lv) ([QLatvia](http://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/qlatvia/)) in October 2018, 
and the most part of it had been developed by him. 
Dr. Maksims Dimitrijevs ([QLatvia](http://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/qlatvia/)) and Dr. Özlem Salehi Köken ([QTurkey](http://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/qturkey/)) also contribued to Bronze by preparing or revising notebooks. 
(Please check the notebook "Credits" for the other contributors.)
Starting from July 7, 2019, Bronze has been on a public gitlab repository and it is expected to have contributions from public as well.

By June 30, 2020, Bronze and its different versions have been used in 31 two-day or three-day long workshops:

## Silver & Gold

Silver is expected to be available by Summer 2020. 

We use [QPool2019](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/qpool2019) for preparing our materials.

The interested people are welcome to participate. (Please check the README file of QPool2019.)
